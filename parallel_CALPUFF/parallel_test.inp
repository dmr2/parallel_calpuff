            be 'BCON'.  Mass is placed in species BCON when
            generating boundary condition puffs so that clean
            air entering the modeling domain can be simulated
            in the same way as polluted air.  Specify zero
            emission of species BCON for all regular sources.


     Analyses of fogging and icing impacts due to emissions from
     arrays of mechanically-forced cooling towers can be performed
     using CALPUFF in conjunction with a cooling tower emissions
     processor (CTEMISS) and its associated postprocessors.  Hourly
     emissions of water vapor and temperature from each cooling tower
     cell are computed for the current cell configuration and ambient
     conditions by CTEMISS. CALPUFF models the dispersion of these
     emissions and provides cloud information in a specialized format
     for further analysis. Output to FOG.DAT is provided in either
     'plume mode' or 'receptor mode' format.

  Note:  The last species in (3a) must be 'BCON' when using the
         boundary condition option (MBCON > 0).  Species BCON should
         typically be modeled as inert (no chem transformation or
         removal).

Subgroup (3b)
-------------
  The following names are used for Species-Groups in which results
  for certain species are combined (added) prior to output.  The
  CGRUP name will be used as the species name in output files.
  Use this feature to model specific particle-size distributions
  by treating each size-range as a separate species.
  Order must be consistent with 3(a) above.

            east or west longitude.  For example,
            35.9  N Latitude  =  35.9N
            118.7 E Longitude = 118.7E


     Datum-region
     ------------

     The Datum-Region for the coordinates is identified by a character
     string.  Many mapping products currently available use the model of the
     Earth known as the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-G ).  Other local
     models may be in use, and their selection in CALMET will make its output
     consistent with local mapping products.  The list of Datum-Regions with
     official transformation parameters is provided by the National Imagery and
     Mapping Agency (NIMA).

INPUT GROUP: 8 -- Size parameters for dry deposition of particles
--------------

     For SINGLE SPECIES, the mean and standard deviation are used to
     compute a deposition velocity for NINT (see group 9) size-ranges,
     and these are then averaged to obtain a mean deposition velocity.

     For GROUPED SPECIES, the size distribution should be explicitly
     specified (by the 'species' in the group), and the standard deviation
     for each should be entered as 0.  The model will then use the
     deposition velocity for the stated mean diameter.

     Data for each source are treated as a separate input subgroup
     and therefore must end with an input group terminator.
    b
     An emission rate must be entered for every pollutant modeled.
     Enter emission rate of zero for secondary pollutants that are
     modeled, but not emitted.  Units are specified by IARU 
     (e.g. 1 for g/m**2/s).
